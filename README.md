Hello,

This portfolio choice case study focuses on John, a 30-year-old software architect working at Alphabet, who recently inherited $300,000 and is looking to invest it for long-term retirement goals. 
Already owning $150,000 in company stock, he wants to diversify away from large-cap growth tech stocks and instead focus on U.S. mid and small-cap value stocks with strong fundamentals. 
He also seeks global diversification across developed and emerging markets, without specific style preferences outside the U.S. Due to potential tax implications, he prefers to limit fixed income investments to U.S.-based securities and maintain 
at least 5% of his portfolio in cash or cash equivalents to manage potential job loss risk. John is not interested in high speculative exposure, capping crypto at a maximum of 1.5%. His investment horizon extends to age 65, with the objective of
maximizing long-term growth while progressively de-risking the portfolio starting at age 55. From that point, his equity allocation will gradually decline by 1% per year, reaching a 60% equity and 40% fixed income/cash split at retirement.

To simplify, we assume that long-term historical returns and risks are representative of future expectations. The strategy relies on a glide path approach to asset allocation, with periodic rebalancing (e.g., monthly or quarterly) to maintain alignment
with the investment policy.

To execute the code, the following Python libraries need to be imported:

**pandas**: Used for data manipulation and analysis, providing powerful data structures like DataFrames.
**numpy**: A library for numerical operations, especially for handling arrays and matrices.
**pandas_datareader**: This is used to retrieve financial data from various online sources, such as Yahoo Finance and Fama-French datasets.
**yfinance**: A library for downloading financial data directly from Yahoo Finance, providing an easy interface for stock price data.
**statsmodels**: A package for performing statistical modeling and hypothesis testing, including linear regression and time series analysis.

We used the extracted data to create various visualizations, including backtest charts to assess the portfolio’s historical performance and rebalancing weight plots to track the evolution of asset allocations over time. 
These Excel-based analyses provide a deeper understanding of how the portfolio adapts to market conditions and ensures that the investment strategy remains aligned with John’s long-term goals.
